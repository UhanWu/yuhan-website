Welcome to my personal website! I'm thrilled to have you here. My name is Yuhan Wu, a senior at  Newton North High School (Fall 2023). This website serves as a platform for me to share my journey both as a student and as a person, showcase some of my achievements, and express my diverse interests. Throughout my high school years, I have actively engaged in various extracurricular activities, including academic competitions, sports, music, and community service projects. I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and growth with you through this website.

Since a young age, I have been intrigued by the practical applications of mathematics and science. It wasn't until I participated in my first math modeling competition that I uncovered the true potential of these subjects. It was during this experience that I discovered the captivating world of data analytics and mathematical modeling, specifically in the realm of statistics. Witnessing the power of data-driven insights and their real-world applications left me in awe.
